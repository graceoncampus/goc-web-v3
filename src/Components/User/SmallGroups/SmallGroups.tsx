          <h2>What are Small Groups?</h2>
          Small groups are the backbone of our discipleship ministry. Each small
          group focuses on Bible study, prayer, fellowship, and accountability.
          In these smaller, more intimate groups, we have the opportunity to
          develop deep relationships so that we can better love, serve, and care
          for each other. Each small group has a leader who will minister to
          your spiritual needs, counsel you through lifeâ€™s tough issues, and
          spur you on in your walk with the Lord.
