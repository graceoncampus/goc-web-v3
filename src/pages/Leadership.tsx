                Matt was born in San Francisco and raised in a Christian home,
                coming to saving faith at a young age. He moved to Los Angeles
                to attend UCLA, and became actively involved at Grace on Campus
                and Grace Community Church during his college years. A graduate
                of The Masterâ€™s Seminary, he has served as the shepherd of Grace
                on Campus since 2021. Matt and his wife Kimmie (also from San
                Francisco and a UCLA alum) are blessed with three boys and a
                girl. In their spare time, the Ngs enjoy watching the Warriors
                when they win, visiting coffee shops around town, and smoking
                meat in their backyard smoker.
