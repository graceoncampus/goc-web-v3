            Small groups are the backbone of our discipleship ministry. Each
            small group focuses on Bible study, prayer, fellowship, and
            accountability. In these smaller, more intimate groups, we have the
            opportunity to develop deep relationships so that we can better
            love, serve, and care for each other. Each small group has a leader
            who will minister to your spiritual needs, counsel you through
            lifeâ€™s tough issues, and spur you on in your walk with the Lord.
