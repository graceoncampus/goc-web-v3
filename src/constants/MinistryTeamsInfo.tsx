    title: "Music Team",
    description:
      "Music team is a ministry dedicated to facilitating and practicing humble worship that flows from Spirit-filled hearts and truth-filled lyrics, as Jesus Himself has commanded us that “those who worship God must worship in spirit and in truth” (John 4:24). As a team, therefore, we seek to recount together God’s works in Scripture and benefits toward us through Jesus Christ, and to respond with joyful praise (Psalm 116:12-13), striving by God’s strength to exemplify Spirit-led and sincere worship that flows from truths that resonate with the redeemed soul (Colossians 3:16) and hearts that have been transformed by God’s lovingkindness (Romans 6:17, Psalm 136). To humbly and confidently approach God week after week in song - in adoration, confession, dedication, lament, meditation, rejoicing - is a privilege particular to every blood-bought Christian (Hebrews 13:12-15), and members of music team have no special stake in that right; we are positioned up front to help facilitate the worship of God’s people as He works in all of our hearts towards worship, and for no other reason. In short, our desire is for the eyes of all to be toward Christ: our Savior, our Great High Priest, our Friend, and our King (Hebrews 12:1-2).",

Our mission is to serve Christ and His body by helping others hear the sermons and songs, and by enhancing an atmosphere of worship and praise to the Lord. You don't have to have any prior experience to join, so we definitely welcome believers who have no experience with any sound equipment! Please come and check us out if you’re interested!",

If you have ever needed accountability or encouragement while you reach out to a non-believing family member or friend, REACH is the ministry team for you.",

    title: "Fisherman's Team",
    description:
      "Fishermen’s Team is GOC’s cold contact evangelism team, deriving its name from the Bible’s analogy of being “fishers of men”. With the world growing in perversion and sinfulness day by day, it is extremely important for us to foster the attitude of being an ambassador for Christ. In the case of Fishermen's team, this is done through a focus on spreading the gospel to strangers and other people outside our normal routine lives. During this time, the team has been meeting over Zoom to cultivate and encourage a greater knowledge of how we can better shine our lights to the world. Since talking and approaching strangers can be tricky, especially during this time, growing in biblical knowledge as well as apologetics helps the team to be better equipped for when more opportunities arise.",
